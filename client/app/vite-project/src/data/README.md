## Usage

### Using the Mock Data Hook

```javascript
import { useMockData, mockAPI } from '../hooks/useMockData';

// In your component
function MyComponent() {
  const { data, loading } = useMockData();
  
  // Or use individual API calls
  const stories = await mockAPI.getStories();
  const story = await mockAPI.getStory('story1');
  const results = await mockAPI.searchStories('dragon');
}
```

### Available Mock API Functions

- `mockAPI.getStories()` - Get all stories
- `mockAPI.getStory(id)` - Get a single story with its paragraphs
- `mockAPI.createStory(storyData)` - Simulate creating a new story
- `mockAPI.getParagraphs(storyId)` - Get all paragraphs for a story
- `mockAPI.addParagraph(storyId, content)` - Simulate adding a paragraph
- `mockAPI.voteParagraph(paragraphId, voteType)` - Simulate voting
- `mockAPI.getCurrentUser()` - Get the mock current user
- `mockAPI.searchStories(query)` - Search stories by title, description, or genre
- `mockAPI.filterByGenre(genre)` - Filter stories by genre

## Integration with Pages

The following pages have been updated to use mock data:

- **Home.jsx** - Displays all 10 stories with search and filter functionality
- **Story.jsx** - Shows individual story with all paragraphs and voting

## Switching to Real API

When your backend is ready, simply replace the `mockAPI` imports with your real API service:

```javascript
// Before (mock data)
import { mockAPI } from '../hooks/useMockData';
const stories = await mockAPI.getStories();

// After (real API)
import { storiesAPI } from '../services/api';
const stories = await storiesAPI.getAll();
```

## Features

- **Realistic delays** - Mock API calls include simulated network delays (150-400ms)
- **Proper data structure** - Follows the same schema as your real backend
- **Vote simulation** - Paragraphs have realistic vote counts (15-40 upvotes, 1-5 downvotes)
- **Varied content** - First 3 stories have full, unique paragraph content; remaining stories use generated content
- **Timestamps** - Realistic creation dates spread across recent months

## Notes

- Mock data is loaded from `src/data/mockData.js`
- The hook provides automatic loading states
- All dates are in ISO format
- User IDs and story IDs use simple string identifiers for easy testing
